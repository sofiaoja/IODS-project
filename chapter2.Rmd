# Insert chapter 2 title here

*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*

- Describe your work and results clearly. 
- Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods
- Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using  

```{r}
# read the data into memory
lrn14 <- read.table("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_2218/datasets/learning2014.txt", sep=",", header=TRUE)

# look at the dimensions of the data
dim(lrn14)

# look at the structure of the data
str(lrn14)

# access the GGally and ggplot2 libraries
library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)

# create a more advanced plot matrix with ggpairs()
p <- ggpairs(lrn14, mapping = aes(), lower = list(combo = wrap("facethist", bins = 20)))

# draw the plot
p

# create a regression model with multiple explanatory variables
#my_model2 <- lm(points ~ attitude + stra + surf, data = learning2014)
my_model2 <- lm(points ~ attitude + stra, data = lrn14)

# print out a summary of the model
my_model2
summary(my_model2)

# draw diagnostic plots using the plot() function. Choose the plots 1, 2 and 5
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(my_model2, which = c(1,2,5))
