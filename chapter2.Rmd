# RStudio Exercise 2

*This week I have learned Data Wrangling and Analysis.*

- Data was preprocessed for further analysis using linear regression model and results were interpreted.

# see the stucture of the new dataset
# learning2014 data set has 166 obs. of 7 variables: gender, Age, Attitude, deep, stra, surf, Points
str(learning2014)

# advanced plot matrix with ggpairs()
p <- ggpairs(learning2014, mapping = aes(), lower = list(combo = wrap("facethist", bins = 20)))

# draw the plot
# Parameters resembling normal distrubtion: Attitude, deep, stra, surf. Strong correlation between points and attitude (0.437), surf and deep (-0.324), surf and stra (-0.161)
p

# print out a summary
summary(learning2014)

# regression model with multiple explanatory variables
# Positive correlation between points and attitude (0.437), points and stra (0.146), negative correlation between points and surf (-0.144). To improve linear model surf parameter excluded.
#my_model <- lm(points ~ attitude + stra + surf, data = learning2014)
my_model <- lm(points ~ attitude + stra, data = learning2014)

# print out a summary of the model
# The relationship between the chosen explanatory variables and the target variable is statistically significant for variable attitude ('***' 0.001), and not for stra ('.' 0.1). Multiple R squared of the model is 0.2048, which is quite low thus linear model might not be optimal model for this data. (Ref Wikipedia: In statistics, the coefficient of multiple correlation is a measure of how well a given variable can be predicted using a linear function of a set of other variables).
summary(my_model)

# diagnostic plots using the plot() function. Residuals vs Fitted values, Normal QQ-plot and Residuals vs Leverage, plots 1, 2 and 5
# Some outliers seen from diagnostic plots, e.g. in Normal Q-Q plot data not linear in the beginnig and at the end points thus linear model might not be optimal model for this data.
