# RStudio Exercise 5

*This week I have learned Dimensionality Reduction Techniques.*

- Data was loaded for further analysis using dimensionality reduction techniques and results were interpreted.

```{r}

# load the data

# read CSV into R
human_ <- read.csv(file="http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_2218/datasets/human2.txt", header=TRUE, sep=",")

# explore the human dataset
# human data: 155 obs. of  8 variables
# The data combines several indicators from most countries in the world
# "Country" = Country name
# # Health and knowledge
# "GNI" = Gross National Income per capita
# "Life.Exp" = Life expectancy at birth
# "Edu.Exp" = Expected years of schooling 
# "Mat.Mor" = Maternal mortality ratio
# "Ado.Birth" = Adolescent birth rate
# # Empowerment
# "Parli.F" = Percetange of female representatives in parliament
# "Edu2.F" = Proportion of females with at least secondary education
# "Edu2.M" = Proportion of males with at least secondary education
# "Labo.F" = Proportion of females in the labour force
# "Labo.M" " Proportion of males in the labour force
# "Edu2.FM" = Edu2.F / Edu2.M
# "Labo.FM" = Labo2.F / Labo2.M

# visualize the 'human_' variables
# Edu.Exp is most normally distributed of the variables.
ggpairs(human_)

# compute the correlation matrix and visualize it with corrplot
# Strong positive correlation with Edu.Exp vs. Life.Exp variables, also strong positive correlation with Mat.Mor vs. Ado.Birth variables. Strong negative correlation with Mat.Mor vs. Life.Exp variables.
